    Father of HTML - Tim Berners-Lee in 1993.
    Basically "!DOCTYPE" is a tag used to tell the browser that this document is an HTML 5 document and render it as a<br>
    HTML 5 documents so, are there any other types of HTML documents as well, of course Yes! there are so many... but we <br>
    are not going to study them as they are not of so use in modern day web development so DOCTYPE which is HTML 5 document <br>
    type is really more than enough for us.
